        extremly powerful web framework that lets developers build extremly
        professional looking web pages extremly quickly. In this tutorial we
        are going to teach you the fundimentals of this extremly powerful tool.
        Before we dive into bootstrap it is important to understand what
        boostrap is. </p> <br>

        <h3>What is Bootstrap?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap is a front-end framework, that provides html, and css
        based templats as well as optional javascript plugins. It is
        designed to give programmers the ability to provide their users a
        friendly, interactive, and responsive user interface.
        </p> <p>
        One of the big wins with bootstrap is the ease of being able to create
        a web application with the ability to dynamically resize to fit on mobile
        platforms as well as desktop platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap was developed at Twitter by Mark Otto and Jacob
        Thornton. They released it as an open source project August 2011.
        Once it became open sourced it became so popular that it was the #1
        project on Github in 2014.</p>

        <h3>What should I know before looking at this page?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap is built off of html5, css, and javascript so before
        diving into bootstrap you should have a very basic understanding of
        what these things are and how to use it. This tutorial also makes use
        of ajax and jquery so it would help to know the basics of those as
        well.</p>
