<body> <div class="container"> <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Bootstrap is an
        extremely powerful web framework that lets developers build very
        professional looking web pages extremely quickly. In this tutorial we
        are going to teach you the fundimentals of this extremely powerful tool.
        Before we dive into bootstrap it is important to understand what
        Boostrap is. </p> <br>

        <h3>What is Bootstrap?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap is a client-side framework. It is primarily a CSS library, although
        it has been extended to work with JavaScript. Bootstrap
        defines a set of consistent CSS templates for building large, professional
        looking web applications. From the beginning, bootstrap was supposed
        to be quick to develop and easy for both the developer and the end
        user. One of the biggest wins with bootstrap is its ability to take advantage
        of the CSS media flags to create consistent looking applications for both
        desktop and mobile clients.

        </p><p>
        Bootstrap allows the user to create a single source and Bootstrap will
        auto-magically dynamically resize to fit a whole array of different
        browser sizes.
        </p>

        One of the big wins with bootstrap is the ease of being able to create
        a web application with the ability to dynamically resize to fit on mobile
        platforms as well as desktop platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap was developed at Twitter by Mark Otto and Jacob
        Thornton. They released it as an open source project August 2011.
        Once it became open sourced it became so popular that it was the #1
        project on Github in 2014.</p>

        <h3>What should I know before looking at this page?</h3>

        <p>Bootstrap is a client-side abstraction layer built on HTML-5, CSS3,
        and JavaScript. Before diving into Bootstrap it would be advantageous
        to be familiar with at least the basics of the common web technologies.

        <p>In addition to these, JQuery is used in some of the following demos.
        JQuery is a "batteries included" library for JavaScript and is extremely
        powerful. Some familiarization with JQuery might be helpful.<p>
